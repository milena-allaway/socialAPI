# Social Network API

## Description
This is an API for a social media network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. This application uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. The API is tested using Insomnia Core. /n
Working with this application, I learned how to build an API using Express.js and how to interact with a MongoDB database using Mongoose. The most challenging part of this project was working with the Mongoose ODM. I had to learn how to use the Mongoose methods to create, read, update, and delete data from the database. The Mongoose documentation was a little confusing but with the help of AI and Google I was able to figure out what I wanted to do. /n
I really enjoy working with databases and APIs. I am looking forward to learning more about them and how to use them in future projects.
